We are building the worlds best todo app
C.R.U.D.

Create / POST(for new stuff)
Create a new Workout on our todo list


Read / GET
reads the items on the list
read only one 1 item from the list


Update / PUT(for updating stuff)
checks off, change, update, an item


Delete / DELETE
removes item from the list (mistake)


GET /todos
return all the todo items on my list


app.get("todos", function(req, res){
    let completed = req.params.completed
} if{

}if else{

}else{
    
}


If range is a shit ton of numbers use an :id variable
GET /todos/:id
return the todo item with id = :id (its going to return the item thats equal to :id) unless there isnt one, return 404


:id is a placeholder for what ever item you chose 



GET /todos/junk
